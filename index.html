		<strong><h3>Hey, I'm Matt!</h3></strong>

		<h2>About Me</h2>

		<p class="about">
			Hi there! I'm a Systems Design Engineering student at the University of Waterloo with a love for creative design, software development and innovation. Currently I am seeking a co-op position for the winter-spring term!
			<br>
			<br>Through my various projects, I have experience with C++, Python, Java, HTML and CSS as well as design experience with Figma and SolidWorks.<br>
			<br>In my spare time I stay active with sports such as hockey and baseball and enjoy any outdoor adventure. I also pursue my passion for design and innovation through side projects, home renovations and build challenges.
